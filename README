Protobuf Analyzer
=================

Description
=================
A Zeek plug in which decodes Protocol Buffer (protobuf), also the plug in has an option to check SQL injection (SQLi).

Credits / References
=================
This plug in uses depends on:

* libinjection by Client9 library for SQL injection detection.
* bro-http2 by MITRE Zeek Plugin for analyzing HTTP/2.

Additionally for testing SQL injection the, the library sql-injection-payload-list by payloadbox has been a great resource for testing the SQL injection detection.

The repository zeek-plugin-protobuf-sqli-test-apps contains apps to generate gRPC (protobuf + HTTP/2) content and capture it in order to perform tests of the plug in.

Development
=================
This plug in has been developed on:

* OS: Ubuntu 22.10 (Kinetic Kudu) Kernel: Linux osboxes 5.19.0-46-generic #47-Ubuntu SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Fri Jun 16 13:30:11 UTC 2023 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

Remarks
=================

* Tested against zeek version 5.0.8

Install
=================

zkg install https://github.com/hmadrigal/zeek-plugin-protobuf-sqli.git

Samples
=================

Enable protobuf (gRPC) file analyzer
=================

# Loads Plugin to analyze protobuf files
@load protobuf

# Handle event, when a text has been detected
event protobuf_string(f: fa_file, text: string)
{
    print fmt("string: %s", text);
}

Enable SQL injection detection module
=================

# The SQL injection modules produces a file sqli_grpc.log with the findings.
# Load protobuf file analyzer
@load protobuf
# Load SQL injection module
@load protobuf/sqli-detect
